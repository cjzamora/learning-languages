# ARM Conditional and Branch Instructions

Here are the ARM conditional and branch instructions.

- Conditionals are used to execute an instruction only if a certain condition is met (e.g., equal, not equal, greater than, etc.).
- Branch instructions are used to change the flow of execution in a program (e.g., jump to a different part of the program).
